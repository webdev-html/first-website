    <p>
        i am a 10 year old frontend developer, this is the first website that i have ever opened to the public.
        <br>
        i started programming at the age of 9, when i was just getting into python, and i was learning the fundementals of programming.
        <br>
        after a few months of python, i got bored of it, and stopped programming, but then in september of 2020, i was bored in lockdown(like most people), so i decided to learn html.
        <br>
        and then it kept on going, from html to css, from css to javascript, and from javascript to web development, and that's how i got here.
