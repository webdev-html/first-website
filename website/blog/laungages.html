        <b>note: this article only represents my opinions, not the best way to learn these things, so research more into these frameworks before you settle on something</b>
        <h2>what should you learn for frontend?</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            first, you will need to learn html, css, and js(javascript), these are the 3 fundemental laungages in frontend web devlopment, and you will use them all the time in frontend development.
            <br>
            <br>
            now, on to the frameworks/extensions.
            <br>
            <br>
            something I and many other js programmers recommend is typescript, it is a super set of javascript, and to summarize it, it is just javascript, but better(you can read the full documentation for typescript<a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs" target="blank_" style="color:lime"> here</a>)
            <br>
            <br>
            (node.js is technically a backend framework, but it is heavily tied with frontend)
            <br>
            you should also learn node.js(or just have it installed) because what node.js does is that it makes it so that you can use javascript for backend, not just frontend, and it makes projects more efficent.
            <br>
            <br>
            another reason to have node.js installed in your path is because it comes with something called npm(node package manager), with this, you can download most major frameworks/extensions(like react and typescript) through it's command line.
            <br>
            <br>
            other frameworks you should learn could be angular or react(react is technicaly a library), i just haven't learned angular or react or got the gist of it, so i can't give my personal opinion.
        </p>
